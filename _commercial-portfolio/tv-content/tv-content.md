	<p>Organic search is an important source of inbound traffic for any site. Unfortunately, True Value's e-commerce site lacked content to capture customers at the top of the shopping funnel. Meanwhile, a moribund sister site TrueValueProjects.com contained hundreds of existing DIY articles that still received organic traffic.</p>
	<p>In response to this, I initiated a project to reuse the existing content to amplify TrueValue.com, incorporating article snippets with the goals of improving SEO, increasing traffic and revenue, and enhancing customers' experience with the brand. I am also managing a long-term project to migrate the complete library to TrueValue.com.</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<h3>Step 1: Analyze & Prioritize Content</h3>
	<p>I used <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to identify the DIY articles on TrueValueProjects.com with the most organic visits, lowest bounce rate, and highest engagement. My main questions were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What content was the most useful and effective for both customers and SEO?</li>
		<li>What content would drive the most traffic to the site?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As it turned out, most of the top-performing subjects, such as how to remove mold or repair a porcelain sink, were outside the focus of marketing campaigns. This suggested that the articles&mdash;by serving diverse, specific interests&mdash;passively expanded the pool of customers and interactions.</p>
	<h3>Step 2: Fix Broken Content</h3>
	<p>I noticed in Google Analytics that organic traffic to the sister site had dramatically decreased during the prior year, when the site was essentially unmaintained. I ran a broken link checker and found hundreds of broken links, which was poor for customers, SEO, and ultimately the brand. The rest of the e-commerce team pitched in to meticulously fix the broken links.</p>
	<h3>Step 3: Design & Build Content Module</h3>
	<p>To incorporate the content on the e-commerce site, I modified existing code on TrueValue.com to create a slider module that displayed article snippets, with images, copy, and links. This involved HTML, LESS/CSS, and Javascript. Because selling products, not content, was the primary focus of the site, I designed the slider to be placed at the bottom of the category landing pages, below the on-page navigation.</p>
	<h3>Step 4: Curate & Edit Content</h3>
	<p>I populated the sliders by curating dozens of articles to complement the main product categories on the site. I selected from the initial priority list, as well as a handful that related to popular products or internal search terms&mdash;signals of customer interest. To give the snippets a clean, modern look, I hunted through hundreds of new images and edited copy as needed. Later, when an SEO agency identified additional articles with top ranking keywords and click-through performance, I incorporated those in successive iterations.</p>
	<h2>Epilogue</h2>
	<p>With limited resources for this self-driven initiative, I enhanced the e-commerce site and enabled it to present a fuller image of the brand. Along with other SEO improvements, such as sitemaps and metadata, this contributed to substantial increases in natural search visits, orders, and revenue year over year. I currently lead a project to refresh and migrate the articles to the e-commerce site and develop a long-term content strategy.</p>
