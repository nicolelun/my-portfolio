	<p>Organic search is an important source of inbound traffic for any site. Unfortunately, the True Value e-commerce site lacked content to capture customers at the top of the shopping funnel. Meanwhile, a moribund sister site TrueValueProjects.com contained hundreds of old DIY articles that still received organic traffic. This presented opportunity to reuse existing content to amplify TrueValue.com.</p>
	<p>I spearheaded projects with the goals of improving SEO on the e-commerce site, increasing traffic and revenue, and enhancing customers' experience with the brand. The first, short-term project was to add article snippets to key pages on TrueValue.com. The second, long-term project&mdash;which built on various fits and starts&mdash;was to refresh and migrate the articles to a content library on TrueValue.com.</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<h3>Step 1: Analyze & Prioritize Content</h3>
	<p>I used Google Analytics to identify the DIY articles on the sister site with the most organic visits, lowest bounce rate, and highest engagement. With hundreds of articles, these metrics served as indicators of the most useful and effective content, for both customers and SEO. As it turned out, most of the top-performing articles, such as how to remove mold or repair a porcelain sink, were not related to marketing campaigns. This suggested their value in expanding the overall pool of customers and interactions through their diverse, but specific subjects.</p>
	<h3>Step 2: Fix Broken Content</h3>
	<p>I noticed in Google Analytics that organic traffic to the sister site had dramatically decreased during the prior year, when the site was essentially unmaintained. I ran a broken link checker and found hundreds of broken links, which was poor for customers, SEO, and ultimately the brand. The rest of the e-commerce team pitched in to meticulously fix the broken links.</p>
	<h3>Step 3: Design & Build Module</h3>
	<p>To incorporate the content on the e-commerce site, I modified existing code on TrueValue.com to create a slider module that displayed article snippets, with images, copy, and links. This involved HTML, LESS/CSS, and Javascript. Because selling products, not content, was the primary focus of the site, I designed the slider to be placed at the bottom of the category landing pages, below the on-page navigation.</p>
	<h3>Step 4: Curate & Edit Content</h3>
	<p>I populated the sliders by curating dozens of articles to complement the main product categories on the site. I selected from the initial priority list, as well as a handful that related to popular products or internal search terms&mdash;signals of customer interest. Later, when an SEO agency identified additional articles with top ranking keywords and click-through performance, I incorporated those in successive iterations. To give the snippets a clean, modern look, I hunted through hundreds of new images and edited copy that was too long.</p>
	<h3>Step 5: Develop Long-Term Solution</h3>
	<p>This project moved the ball forward by creating something useful with the limited resources at hand. But customers and SEO would benefit even more from refreshed articles migrated to the e-commerce site&mdash;and, of course, brand-new articles. With analyses from an SEO agency and support from internal stakeholders, the rest of the e-commerce team partnered to develop a business case with estimated ROI for this long-term effort.</p>

These short tips gave advice on everything from fertilizing your lawn to power washing your patio to storing wet paint brushes.
