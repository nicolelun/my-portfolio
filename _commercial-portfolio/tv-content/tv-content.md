	<p>Organic search is an important source of inbound traffic for any site. Unfortunately, the True Value e-commerce site lacked content to capture customers at the top of the shopping funnel. Meanwhile, a moribund sister site TrueValueProjects.com contained hundreds of existing DIY articles that still received organic traffic.</p>
	<p>I initiated a project to reuse the existing content to amplify TrueValue.com, incorporating article snippets with the goals of improving SEO, increasing traffic and revenue, and enhancing customers' experience with the brand. <!-- I also advocated for a second project&mdash;still pending&mdash; to refresh and migrate the articles to TrueValue.com. --></p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<h3>Step 1: Analyze & Prioritize Content</h3>
	<p>I used Google Analytics to identify the DIY articles on TrueValueProjects.com with the most organic visits, lowest bounce rate, and highest engagement. With hundreds of articles, these metrics served as indicators of the most useful and effective content, for both customers and SEO. As it turned out, most of the top-performing subjects, such as how to remove mold or repair a porcelain sink, were outside the focus of marketing campaigns. This suggested that by serving specific but diverse interests, they passively expanded the pool of customers and interactions.</p>
	<h3>Step 2: Fix Broken Content</h3>
	<p>I noticed in Google Analytics that organic traffic to the sister site had dramatically decreased during the prior year, when the site was essentially unmaintained. I ran a broken link checker and found hundreds of broken links, which was poor for customers, SEO, and ultimately the brand. The rest of the e-commerce team pitched in to meticulously fix the broken links.</p>
	<h3>Step 3: Design & Build Content Module</h3>
	<p>To incorporate the content on the e-commerce site, I modified existing code on TrueValue.com to create a slider module that displayed article snippets, with images, copy, and links. This involved HTML, LESS/CSS, and Javascript. Because selling products, not content, was the primary focus of the site, I designed the slider to be placed at the bottom of the category landing pages, below the on-page navigation.</p>
	<h3>Step 4: Curate & Edit Content</h3>
	<p>I populated the sliders by curating dozens of articles to complement the main product categories on the site. I selected from the initial priority list, as well as a handful that related to popular products or internal search terms&mdash;signals of customer interest. To give the snippets a clean, modern look, I hunted through hundreds of new images and edited copy as needed. Later, when an SEO agency identified additional articles with top ranking keywords and click-through performance, I incorporated those in successive iterations.</p>
	<h2>Epilogue</h2>
	<p>With limited resources for this self-driven initiative, I enhanced the e-commerce site and enabled it to present a fuller image of the brand. However, I would have liked to measure the impact on SEO, traffic, and revenue, the main KPIs. Ultimately, I believe that the biggest benefit to customers and the business would come from refreshing and migrating the articles. With analyses from an SEO agency, the e-commerce team developed a business case to advocate for this long-term, future effort.</p>
