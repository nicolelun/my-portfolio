			<p>
				Across different forms and media, I often explore the wonders and truths hidden in plain sight &mdash; the poetry in the everyday. On commercial projects, I translate your vision and the spirit of your brand to help bring to life the story behind the data. I have a Master of Fine Arts in Visual Communication Design from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago, and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Smith College.
