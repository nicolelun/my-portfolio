<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Over the course of a year, I reskinned portions of TrueValue.com to refine the visual presentation and reduce friction in the shopping, checkout, and order status experiences, especially on mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Some parts of the interface were confusing or difficult to use, including key elements such as the header, filter, and mobile touch targets. My goal was to reduce friction in problem areas and polish the presentation of the brand, contributing to increased engagement and conversion.</p>

<h2>Users & Audience</h2>
<p>New and existing customers of TrueValue.com</p>

<h2>My Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
<p>As the sole designer and front-end developer, I performed the research, design, and coding to reskin key elements and pages on the site. </p>

<h2>Scope & Constraints</h2>
<p>With no access to the underlying templates or structure of the site, my changes were limited to the front-end styling (LESS/CSS).</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>Research Best Practices in E-Commerce and UI Design</h3>
<p>The third-party usability audits had provided a robust starting point for understanding areas of opportunity on the site. To supplement this, I researched best practices and recommendations in e-commerce UX design, such as those from the Baymard Institute. I also examined design systems for inspiration, relying particularly on Material IO for its focus on mobile.</p> 
<h3>Develop Design Concepts</h3>
<p>I created some design concepts in Sketch, focusing on elements and pages that were core to the shopping experience and received the most use: header, category listing pages, product listing pages, and product detail pages. Many of the changes involved information design, for example, ensuring that related information was visually grouped together, important cues were above the fold, or color contrast complied with WCAG. Also, many of the changes were specific to mobile, for example, ensuring that touch targets were big and information lists could be scanned in a small viewport. I kept much of the original design aesthetic, so that each modified portion could still operate within a unified whole.</p>
<h3>Build and Deploy the Code</h3>
<p>Reskinning the site required changes to the styling, so I created a local Git environment, coded the changes in LESS, and inserted the resulting CSS on the site. One of the biggest constraints of the project was that many useful enhancements would have required modifying the underlying PHP templates, which were only accessible to our third-party system integrator. Without a dedicated budget for that, the project was limited to what could be controlled through styling. In addition, we lacked an A/B testing tool, which would have provided the ability to test and compare different concepts in the field.</p>
<h3>Continuously Refine the Design</h3>
<p>In the months after deploying the initial changes, I repeated much of the process on other parts of the site, including checkout and order status. Hotjar added another set of data to analyze and understand pain points, particularly in forms and multi-page flows. In checkout, for instance, some users skipped parts of the flow, only to later backtrack when the site displayed an error message or prompted them to try again.
</p>
<h2>Outcomes & Results</h2>
<p>Over the course of several months, I reskinned key portions of the shopping, checkout, and order status experiences, but integrated them with the rest of the site to maintain a unified whole. My goal was to reduce friction for customers and ultimately increase engagement and conversion. Ideally, we would have measured the effect, isolating it from other variables such as seasonal swings in shopping behavior, but resource constraints demanded priorities elsewhere.</p>
