This commercial project created a set of exhibition brochures for the 23rd Annual Art Appreciation Exhibition by Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal USA, Inc. in partnership with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Eye-popping and energetic, these matching brochures differentiate the summer and winter shows.
